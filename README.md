##How data was obtained
Original data sourced from Aaron Sarver, Buncombe County Sheriff's Office, on 08/20/2021 via FOIA request

Date range requested: 01/01/2019 to 06/30/2021
Date range provided: 01/01/2019 to 08/19/2021

Data was provided in an excel spreadsheet with two workbooks. One workbook appears to contain a case file listing with only one charge listed while the second appears to contain each charge as a separate row which results in duplicate case files being listed. Email request sent asking the difference betwen OCA and Case_ID fields and asked to clarify difference between workbooks.

Email chains attached. In this scenario, I needed to enlist the assistance of an individual with another police force who was helpful in the past on how to phrase requests to obtain data from agencies. His information was redacted.
