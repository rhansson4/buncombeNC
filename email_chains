Hi Mr. XXX and Mr. Hansson,

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet with the information you requested. Please let me know if this
fulfills your request.

Sorry for my initial confusion about what information is available from RMS. One of our IT staff and was able
to pull this information.

Additionally, Mr. XXXX, I know that many current Detectives how you in very high regard. If you see any patterns or trends of note - positive/negative/whatever - I'm sure our team at CID would be interested in your thoughts and perspective.

Hi XXXX,

My understanding is that RMS does not have the case adjudication info.  As you know, plea deals, etc. means 
cases and charges often get consolidated, but I am going to ask someone in CID with more expertise than me if this report can be produced.

I'm copying Mr. Hansson on your request as they seem to be similar.

Good morning. I sent a request to Mr Server a few weeks ago and had not received a response. I am writing to find out if I had inquired with the right person or if I should have made the request another way. My request is below, please let me know if I should use another method to request this information.

Good morning,

I am told that you are the correct person to make this request, if not, could you please direct me to the proper person. I am attempting to compare a few agencies similar to Buncombe County and wonder if you could please provide me with the following report information in an excel-type format from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021
Case number or some unique identification number
Month crime happened
Year crime happened
List of all crimes listed on the report
Report outcome
Example:
210309321, March, 2021, Larceny, Vandalism, Pending Investigation

Thank you for responding. You do not have electronic case records that would list crimes, dates of occurrences and outcomes? Do you have a list of UCR statistics for that time period that you could share?
